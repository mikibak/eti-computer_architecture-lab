# eti-computer_architecture-lab

I guess I'm not allowed to publish instructions. If you are a student you have access to them anyway. 
If you just want to check out my assembly skills, topics of each lab (folder names), file names and some comments here and there must do.

Keep in mind that this material is only lab related - most of my programs and all exam preparations are in my paper notebook 
(I love Mamasz Dziubale and writing code on paper during his exams). No easy way to share that with you!

I used visual studio 2019 and Asm Dude (https://github.com/HJLebbink/asm-dude) for syntax highliting.
I greatly recommend this tool! As of 2023, Asm Dude is only available for visual studio 2019.
